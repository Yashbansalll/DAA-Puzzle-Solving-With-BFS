This Project is for solving puzzle by using BFS (Breadth First Search) Algorithm.
8-Puzzle-Solver-Using-BFS
Solving 8 Puzzle problem with BFS algorithm:

3x3 matrix is presented as String,

one element "0" can be moved to four positions (up, down, left, right),

solution is getting string of "123456780",

initial state is generated by moving "0" to random positions 1000 times,

all the possible states are added to queue,

each state is mapped to it's parent(state before moving "0"),

BFS algorithm finds shortest path from initial state to solution.
